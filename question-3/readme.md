# Question.3 : create your custom react using JS and render anchor tag.

This question is asking you to create a simplified, custom version of React in JavaScript to understand how React-like rendering works. Instead of using React itself, you will simulate React's behavior by creating and rendering a custom "React element" (which in this case is an anchor tag <a>). You'll use JavaScript to render the element into a "root" element on the page.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the task:

Steps:

-Create an object representing a React element: This object will have information about the HTML tag and its properties, like href for an anchor tag.

-Create a function to convert this object into actual HTML: This function takes the custom object (like the React element) and converts it into HTML code (i.e., <a> tag).

-Create a function to render the HTML on the page: This function will "render" the generated HTML into the root element of the HTML document.
